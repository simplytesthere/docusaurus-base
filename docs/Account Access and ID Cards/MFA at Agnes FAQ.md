## What is MFA?

MFA makes your account more secure by forcing you to verify that it's you who is signing in every time. All forms of MFA require at least two layers of authentication to access an account – the primary being your password and the secondary being some other form of verification. You will need the following to setup MFA: 

- The Microsoft Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet ([Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) | [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US&pli=1)) 
- Your personal cell number or, if you’re an employee, your Avaya Cloud office number

## Why does Agnes Scott use MFA?

Agnes Scott implemented MFA to reduce the chances of a cyber attack succeeding and affecting various campus resources and individual accounts.  

## How do I set up MFA? 

:::Important

If you have yet to sign into your ASC account, please use a computer or a device other than your phone to follow the instructions below. 

:::

### Step 1:  Sign into the account

1. Go to https://scottiemail.agnesscott.edu

2. Sign in using your full ASC email address and your password. Click **Next** after inputting each. 

   You will see a page that says **More information required**. 

3. Click the **Next** button. 

   The webpage for MFA setup will open.

### Step 2: Set up the Microsoft Authenticator App

1. If you haven't already, download the **Microsoft Authentication App** on the device you wish to use for secondary verification ([Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) | [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US&pli=1)).

2.  On the **Start by getting the app** page, hit **Next**.

3. Open the Authenticator app. When prompted, tap **Turn on notifications** (you must enable notifications for the app to work). 

4. Within the app, tap **Add an account** > **Work or School account**.

5. On the website, hit **Next**. The website will prompt you to scan a QR code. 

6. On the app, tap **Scan a QR code** then use your phone’s camera to scan the website’s QR Code.

   On the app, you will be prompted to input the number displayed on the website and then to use your phone's secure login method (ex: pattern, Face ID, thumbprint, etc.). 

7. Type in the number and complete your phone's secure login method. 

8. Once you’ve answered the phone prompt, you will see a **Notification approved** screen on the website. Click **Next**.

### Step 3: Input  and verify a phone number

:::tip
We recommend using the text option for the verification code. If you chose the phone call option, which is only the best option if you're using an Avaya Cloud Office phone without an accessible email associated, you must press the pound key (#) as soon as you answer the phone to complete the MFA process. 
:::

- Single-User Accounts (employee or student): Use your personal cell number *or*, if you’re an employee, your Avaya Cloud Office phone number. 
- Generic Accounts (multi-user accounts): Use an Avaya Cloud office phone number. 

1. On the website, input *the desired phone number*. Click **Next**.
2. On the phone, view the verification code or answer the call then immediately press the pound (#) key. If applicable on the website, input the verification code into the appropriate box on the screen.
3. On the website, click **Next**. 

### Step 4: Access the account

If you see a screen that says **Success**, you've completed MFA setup for your account. 

1. Click **Done** to access your account. 


## What should I use as my default secondary MFA? 

The college recommends you use the Microsoft Authenticator app as your default secondary verification method. This will allow you to receive codes even if you are out of the country or in an area with poor/no cellular coverage.

While acceptable, using a phone number as the default secondary verification method can prevent sign-in if you lose access to your phone or have poor cellular service.


## I want to be able to use MFA on a second device. How do I set that up?

1. On a computer or laptop, log into this website with your ASC account credentials and your current MFA device: [https://aka.ms/mfasetup](https://aka.ms/mfasetup) . 

   A webpage entitled **My Sign-Ins** will appear. 

2. Click the **Security Info** section. 

3. Within the **Security Info** section, you can both...
   - add a new sign-in method within the following options: an alternative phone number and/or an alternative Authenticator app phone/tablet
   - change the default authentication method within the following options: phone call, text, authentication app notification,  or authentication app code.

## I got a new phone and now MFA doesn't work. What should I do?

If you recently upgraded/replaced your phone or had to change phone numbers, MFA will be unavailable on that device until it is added to your account. To add the new device to your account, you will need to do *one* of the following:

- Use the old device to sign into this link and click the **Add sign-in method** button to add your new device: https://aka.ms/mfasetup
- [Contact the ASC Help Desk](https://asc-testsite2.netlify.app/docs/contact-info-hours) for an MFA Reset. Once the MFA Reset is complete, you will be prompted to re-do the MFA setup process the next time you access your account, allowing you to connect your new device.
