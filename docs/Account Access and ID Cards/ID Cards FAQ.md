## How do we use ID Cards at Agnes Scott?
ID cards are vital to your life at Agnes. They allow you to get into certain doors and buildings. They also act as on-campus identification for safety purposes, meal plans, library checkouts, and printing. Additionally, if you show your ID card at some local businesses, you can get a discount!

## I lost my ID card. What should I do?
You can do one of the following:
- *Come to the ITS during our business hours*. We will print out a new one for you.
- *Submit a ticket at itshelp@agnesscott.edu* . We will print out a new one for you and email you to come pick it up.

If you are a student, there will be a $15 charge added to your billing account to cover the cost of printing a new ID. 
## When I scan my badge at a printer, it asks me to login using my ASC account. What's going on?
This means that your ID card number, which is on the back bottom right of your card, has not been added to the print system. To rectify this, you can do one of the following:
- Come to the ITS during our business hours. We will add your card number to the print system.
- Submit a ticket to itshelp@agnesscott.edu with a picture of the front and back of your ID card. We will notify you once the print system has been updated. 

## My ID card stopped letting me into doors/buildings. What can I do?

Please either stop by the ITS during our business hours or submit a ticket at itshelp@agnesscott.edu. In either case, be specific about where you were trying to access. We will troubleshoot. If a new ID card is needed, we will print you another one -- free of charge if you still have your old one. 

## My ID card has never worked. What's going on?
Most likely, you card number needs to be added to the ID card system. Please either stop by the ITS Hel Desk during our business hours or submit a ticket at itshelp@agnesscott.edu that includes a picture of the front and back of your ID card. We will verify that your card number is added to the ID card system and go from there.
