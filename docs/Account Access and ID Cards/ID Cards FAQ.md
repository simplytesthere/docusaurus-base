## How do we use ID Cards at Agnes Scott?
ID cards are vital to your life at Agnes. They allow you to get into certain doors and buildings. They also act as on-campus identification for safety purposes, meal plans, library checkouts, and printing. Additionally, if you show your ID card at some local businesses, you can get a discount!

## I lost my ID card. What should I do?
You can [stop by the ASC ITS or submit a ticket via email](https://asc-testsite2.netlify.app/docs/contact-info-hours). If you submit a ticket via email, we will email you when the card is ready to be picked up. 

If you are a student, a $15 charge will be added to your billing account to cover the cost of printing a new ID. 
## When I scan my badge at a printer, it asks me to log in using my ASC account. What's going on?
This means your ID card number (on the back of the card in the bottom-right corner) has not been added to the print system. To rectify this, you can do one of the following:
- Come to the ITS during our business hours. We will add your ID card number to the print system.
- Submit a ticket to itshelp@agnesscott.edu with a picture of the front and back of your ID card. We will notify you once the print system has been updated. 

## My ID card stopped letting me into doors/buildings. What can I do?

You can [stop by the ASC ITS or submit a ticket via email](https://asc-testsite2.netlify.app/docs/contact-info-hours). In either case, be specific about where you were trying to access. We will troubleshoot. If a new ID card is needed, we will print you another one â€“ free of charge if you still have your old one. 

## My ID card has never worked. What's going on?
Most likely, your ID card number must be added to our ID card system. You can [stop by the ASC ITS or submit a ticket via email](https://asc-testsite2.netlify.app/docs/contact-info-hours). If you submit a ticket via email, include pictures of the front and back of your ID card. We will verify that your card number is in the ID card system and go from there.
