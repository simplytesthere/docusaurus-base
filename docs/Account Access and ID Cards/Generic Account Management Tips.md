## Overview

Here are answers to common questions about generic account management. After reading this FAQ, you will be able efficiently and easily manage a generic account. 

## What is a generic account?

A generic account is an ASC account meant for general departmental purposes. This account may act as the first point of contact for people with inquiries for your department.

We recommend that every generic account has at least one Account Manager, who is the one person who has the password and the default MFA verification associated with their device.

## Several people need to be able to check a generic email account. Any recommendations? 

If several people must check the generic account's email at any point, we recommend setting up email delegation. This way, multiple people can check the account without interacting with MFA. 

The Account Manager should do the following to setup email delegation:
1. Open an **Incognito** ([Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=EN&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)) or a **Private** ([Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history#w_how-do-i-open-a-new-private-window) | [Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/browse-privately-ibrw1069/mac)) window in your browser. Doing this will thwart potential sign-in conflicts with your personal ASC account. 
2. Navigate to https://scottiemail.agnesscott.edu 
3. Sign in and complete the MFA process.
4. Follow these instructions from Google to invite your personal ASC account and other accounts to check the generic email without having to do MFA: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/138350?hl=en

## Multiple people must use the generic account to access a browser-based licensed application (Smartsheet, etc). What should we do?

In this case, it would be best if the Account Manager added everyone who needs to access those applications as an MFA alternative. 

Please refer to [MFA at Agnes FAQ > I want to be able to use MFA on a second device. How do I set that up?](https://asc-testsite2.netlify.app/docs/account-access-id-cards/MFA#i-want-to-be-able-to-use-mfa-on-a-second-device-how-do-i-set-that-up) to add other individuals to the MFA. We recommend using their Avaya Cloud Office or personal number as alternative verifications for ease. When they sign in, they must hit "**I can't use my Authenticator app right now**" and find the verification method associated with their phone number. 

Alternatively, the Account Manager can collaborate with whoever needs access to set up alternative Authenticator app users.
