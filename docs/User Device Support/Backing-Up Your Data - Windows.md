Before upgrading/replacing your computer, we advise backing up your data. 

While we will perform a data backup, we will only backup your user folder. *This doesn't include your browser bookmarks*. If you save data elsewhere or under another login, you either need to specify to us what logins or perform the backup yourself. 

## Step 1: Back Up Your Bookmarks
The easiest way to backup your bookmarks is to sign into the browser(s) you use with your ASC email and sync the data. Doing so will mean that your bookmarks will go with you whenever you sign into the browser(s) on your new computer.

## Step 2: Back Up Your Files

:::warning

Do not use a network share (aka "the W drive") to backup your files. A network share is designed to share documents amongst your department and storage space is limited.

There are multiple ways to backup your data, but the two best options are as follows:

| Option                     | Best For...                                                  | Tools Needed                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| External Storage           | Those that have many and/or large files that will not upload quickly to Google Drive. Additionally, this is the best option if you use specialized software with unique file extensions. | A blank 1 TB external hard drive (HD)                        |
| Google Drive Cloud Storage | Those that have a small number of documents (PDF and Word files) and images. | [Google Drive Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) |

### External Storage Backup

### Google Drive Cloud Storage
1. While signed into your ASC account, download **Google Drive Desktop** and follow the prompts.
