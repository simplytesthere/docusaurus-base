Before upgrading/replacing your computer, we advise backing up your data. 

While we will perform a data backup, we will only backup your user folder. *This doesn't include your browser bookmarks*. If you save data elsewhere or under another login, you either need to specify to us what logins or perform the backup yourself. 

## Step 1: Back Up Your Bookmarks
The easiest way to backup your bookmarks is to sign into the browser(s) you use with your ASC email and sync the data. Doing so will mean that your bookmarks will go with you whenever you sign into the browser(s) on your new computer.

## Step 2: Back Up Your Files

:::warning
Do not use a network share (aka "the W drive") to backup your files. A network share is designed to share documents amongst your department and storage space is limited.
:::


There are multiple ways to backup your data, but the two best options are as follows:

| Option                     | Best For...                                                  | Tools Needed                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| External Storage           | Those that have many and/or large files that will not upload quickly to Google Drive. Additionally, this is the best option if you use specialized software with unique file extensions. | 1 TB External HD                                             |
| Google Drive Cloud Storage | Those that have a small number of documents (PDF and Word files) and images. | [Google Drive Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) |
### External Storage Backup

1. Plug in a blank self-purchased external HD into your *old* Mac.
2. Follow the instructions found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250). If your new device is a MacBook, make sure it's plugged in for the duration of this process.
3. Once the Time Machine backup has been completed, eject the external HD.

### Google Drive Cloud Storage
1. While signed into your ASC account, download Drive and follow prompts
2. Check the boxes beside each folder on your computer you would like to have backed up to the cloud.
3. Wait for the files to upload to Google Drive. You may continue using your computer while the files upload.
4. To verify that your files have been backed up, go to your Google Drive and select **Computers**. There you should see a folder entitled your computer name, and within it, all of the files that you've backed up. 

## Step 3: Restore Your Files
Once you've received your new computer, it's time to restore your files!

Here's how:

### Restoring from an External Storage Backup

:::warning
Please follow the instructions below. Do not do the default Time Machine restore as that can mess up ASC-specific configurations for your new Mac.
:::

1. Plug in your Time Machine backup into your *new* Mac.
2. Follow steps 2 - 6 listed [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203981)
3. When selecting the information to transfer, *only* select your user folder. *DO NOT* select the other options.
4. Click continue to start the transfer. If your new device is a MacBook, make sure it's plugged in for the duration of this process.
9. Your files have been restored.
### Restoring from a Google Drive Cloud Backup
1. Sign into your new computer. 
2. Using your ASC credentials, sign into Google Drive. 
3. Navigate to the **Computers** folder on the left-side of the screen. 
4. Click the three-dots on the folder entitled your old computer name. Select **Download** on the menu that appears.
5. Wait while the ZIP file downloads. Once the ZIP file has downloaded, double-click it. The ZIP file will automatically extract its contents.
7. Copy and paste the files into their appropriate folder(s) on your computer.
