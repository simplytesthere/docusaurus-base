## What can I submit a ticket about?
You can submit a ticket about anything related to technology at Agnes Scott. This may include the following (not an exhaustive list):
- College-owned device support
- Audio/Visual classroom and meeting space components
- Connecting your personal device to an ASC network
- Canvas
- Telecommunications (Avaya Cloud Office, etc)
- Administrative systems (Colleague, Informer, etc.)
- General network issues

## Any tips for submitting a ticket?
Whenever submitting a ticket, be prepared with the following:
- Your ASC ID number (for phone calls)
- A specific description of the issue that you're having

What entails a specific description? Providing as many details as possible about your issue! 

For example, instead of saying "My computer is slow.", say something like "My computer is slow to boot up." or "When I'm using the internet, my pages take a long time to load." The more information ITS has upfront, the quicker we can resolve your issue.
