## Do I have to purchase all technology through the ITS?

All computers and tablets must be purchased through ASC ITS. This is because we must configure the devices for our environment so we can support them. *If you purchase a computer or tablet without the ASC ITS involvement, we will not support the device outside of connecting it to the on-campus network.*

If you need accessories – such a keyboard, mouse, laptop bag, etc. – you can either purchase through us or using your department's p-card. 

## I need a new computer. What should I order?

We have standard purchasing bundles now! As of June 2024, here are the bundles:

| Package Title | Ideal For...                               | Contents                                   | Monitor(s)                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Standard      | Employees in non-executive roles           | HP ProBook 440 G10 Laptop, Docking Station | 27-inch Acer Monitor(s) or 32-inch LG Monitor(s) |
| Executive     | Executive employees (VPs, Directors, etc.) | HP Elite Dragonfly, Docking Station        | 27-inch Acer Monitor(s) or 32-inch LG Monitor(s) |
| Power User    | Employees who need a high-powered setup    | HP Zbook Firefly, Docking Station          | 27-inch Acer Monitor(s) or 32-inch LG Monitor(s) |
| Mac User      | Employees who are used to macOS            | MacBook Pro, Docking Station               | 27-inch Acer Monitor(s) or 32-inch LG Monitor(s) |

You may notice that all of our packages include a laptop and a docking station. This is because we are encouraging everyone to use a more flexible setup.  

This more flexible setup enables you to travel with your main computer by simply detaching the laptop from the docking station. Additionally, everyone just having one device reduces the number of devices ITS has to service. 

If you want a desktop instead, here are our options:

| Desktop Type      | Model                           | Monitor(s)                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Microsoft Windows | HP Elite Mini 800 G9 Desktop PC | 27-inch Acer Monitor(s) or 32-inch LG Monitor(s) |
| Apple macOS       | iMac                            | N/A                                              |

## What's the purchasing process?

1. Contact itshelp@agnesscott.edu using the following template to receive a quote:
	- *DEVICE/BUNDLE*:
	- *LINK TO DEVICE (if not referenced in the above bundles)*:
	- *QUANITY OF DEVICE(S)/BUNDLE(S)*:
	- *MONITOR SIZE (if needed)*:
	- *MONITOR QUANITY (if needed)*:
	- *FUTURE DEVICE OWNER(S)*:
	- *BUDGET MANAGER (for approval)*:
	- *GL-CODE (will only be used upon quote approval)*:
2. We will email your budget manager and you with the quote. *If your budget manager is comfortable with the price, they must respond to the email with "I approve of this purchase"*.
3. Once ITS receives the approval email, we will purchase the device(s). You will receive confirmation from us of the purchase.
4. We will inform you once the device has arrived and has been configured for use (if applicable).

## I want to buy my old device. How do I go about that?
We allow users to buy their old device(s) *that are out-of-warranty*. If your old device is not out-of-warranty, it will be put back into circulation.

The formula for the cost is as follows: 

```
Initial Cost/(Current Year - Year of Deployment) = Purchase Amount
Example: $2000/(2024 - 2019) = $400
```
